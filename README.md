## Introduction

This is an educational boilerplate created for a lesson about creating your own GraphQL server.

This code is not safe for production use.

## How to start

- First of all you have to run database
```
  docker-compose up -d
```
- Next step is installing dependencies
```
yarn install
```
- ***Optional*** You also could set fixtures data into your db via next command
```
yarn seed
```
- Run project
```
yarn start
```

Server will start by the next path `http://localhost:9090/`
